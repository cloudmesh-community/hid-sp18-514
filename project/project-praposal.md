## Abstract

It is observed that a lot of real-life data, from personal expenses to world population data, tend to obey Benford’s Law. 
Because of this phenomenon, Benford’s Law has been leveraged in a lot of statistical analysis – including fraud detection. 
In 2009,  Benford’s Law has been utilized to detect election fraud in Iran. In this paper, 
the authors will determine the universality of the law. Is the law applicable to any dataset? 
The authors will analyze and visualize data on publicly available data sets at data.gov and determine which datasets follow this law and which ones do not, if any.

## Introduction

Benford’s law is a phenomenon about the distribution of the first-digits of numerical sets of real-life data. The law states that the distribution of the first digits follows a certain mathematical pattern. For example, the digit 1 tends to occur about 30% of the time compared to 11% if the distribution is evenly flat. The probability distribution tends to go lower from the digit 1 to the digit 9. 

A dataset is said to satisfy Benford’s Law if the leading digits have the following the probability distribution:

In mathematical terms, Benford’s Law can be represented by the following equation: 

P(d) = log (d+1) - log (d)

Example: In case base 10 is used we obtain the probability for the leading digit 1, as

P(1) = log (1+1) - log(1) = 0.301 

which means, if the dataset complies with Benford's Law, the probability of finding a leading digit 1 is about 30.1% of the time. Therefore, Benford’s Law indicates that the most likely leading digit for us to see is 1, the second most likely 2, the third most 3, the fourth most likely 4, and so on. 

The logarithmic function can be in any base. We will be developing a REST service that allows the calculation of Benfords Law. The service will allow us to specify the base and the data set as input. 

Benford’s law not only applys to the scale invariant data but also applies to various data sources, that we are going to analyze and visualize in this project.

## Scope of work
- Define Benford’s Law
  - Show mathematical formula
  - Show the probability distribution (graph) according to Benford’s Law
- Download and store the following datasets from data.gov
  - National Student Loan Student system
  - National Stock Number Extract
  - Demographic Statistics
  - Consumer Fraud Refunds
  - Hospital Compare Data
  - Medicare Cost Reports
  - And Etc, there will be additional (4) datasets

- Analyze the data. And select the data field on which Benford’s Law will be applied.
- Draw the probability distribution of the first digits of the selected field.
- Compare the distribution in #4 with the expected Benford’s law distribution in #1
- Draw conclusions

## Technology Stack

Python will be used for Data Analytics and Visualization. As we are planning to analyze multiple data sets to check whether Benford’s law can be applied either HBase or MySQL database will be used for storing Big data set.

several REST services will be used to make this a general cloud based service framework:

* REST data service: A service to upload data to the analysis service. Input is the url of the source data. the location is communicated and the data is asynchronously downloaded. A status can be requested and shows how much % is fetched and if it is done.

* REST computation servise: the computation service computes the benfords law while using the base and the data stored in the data service as inout. A status message can be used to identify if the comoutation is completed

* REST visualization service: once the data is computed, it is used visualize the data and retrieve images that are to be placed into reports, The format is to be PDF, Input parameters such as font size and other things are tib be considered. The data is also be placed onto a Web service so that it can be viewed online.

* REST parameter sweep service: variation of the base is conducted to provide the best fit based on the base.

As this is a two person project deployment on two different cloud infrastructures needs to be provided. We recommend the deployment on kupernetes using echo and chameleon cloud. 

## Special Consideration to Project Format

* REST schemas: The project will include the definition of Schemas that can be included as Figures in the appendix to this paper and as bibtex refernces. Howeverthey will not count towards the paper length.

* Work breakdown: The appendix includes a small section with an itemized list of the work breakdown to document what each student did.

Apache Zookeeper, a centralized distributed

API framework and utilities to make using Apache Zookeeper much easier
and more reliable.  It also includes recipes for common use cases and
extensions such as service discovery and a Java 8 asynchronous
DSL''\cite{hid-sp18-514-apachecurator}.  The Curator framework consists
of set of API's that prominently streamline using Zookeeper.  This
framework adds various features ``that build on Zookeeper and handles
the complexity of managing connections to the Zookeeper cluster and
retrying operations.  Some of the features are: Automatic connection
management, Cleaner API, Recipe
